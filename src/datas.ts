With a passion for creating seamless user experiences, I crafted this chat app from the ground up, building the front-end using React for its intuitive interface and dynamic interactions. On the back-end, I leveraged the powerful combination of PostgreSQL, Express, Node.js, and incorporated Socket.IO for real-time messaging capabilities. To ensure secure user interactions, I implemented JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication, providing a robust authentication system. For seamless communication with the PostgreSQL database, I utilized Knex, a query builder for Node.js.",

I'm proud to present this project as an example of how my skills can be utilized to create efficient, secure, and user-friendly applications."

The extracted text is then processed using a custom Regex algorithm that I've developed through extensive experiments and research with various cover formats.",
